//aggregation example
//Concept: Aggregation vs. Composition
// Both aggregation and composition create relationships between classes, but they differ in their strength of association:

// Composition (what you just practiced): Represents a strong relationship between objects. If the containing object is destroyed, 
// so are its components. For example, a Library and its Books â€” if the library closes, the collection may no longer be relevant in
//  that context.

// Aggregation: Represents a weaker association between objects. The contained object can exist independently of the container. 
// For instance, a Team has Players, but if the team disbands, the players still exist independently.

// In terms of implementation:

// Composition usually has private members created within the containing class.
// Aggregation often involves objects that are passed into the containing class and can exist outside of it.

public class tengpt {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating players independently
        Player p1 = new Player("Alice");
        Player p2 = new Player("Bob");
        
        // Creating a team and adding players
        Team teamA = new Team("Warriors");
        teamA.addPlayer(p1);
        teamA.addPlayer(p2);
        
        // Displaying team information
        teamA.showTeam();
    }
}
