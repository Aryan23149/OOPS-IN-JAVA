// Exercise
// Create your own custom exception class called InvalidInputException, which is thrown when the input 
// is not within a specified range.

// InvalidInputException if the number is not between 1 and 100.
// Use a try-catch block in the main method to catch and handle the exception,
//  displaying a meaningful error message to the user.
